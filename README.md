## Overview

Revm is a highly efficient and stable implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) written in Rust.

![banner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bluealloy/revm/refs/heads/main/assets/logo/revm-banner.png)

Known for its robustness, it stands as one of the most popular libraries and critical components of the Ethereum ecosystem. Revm plays a crucial role across various projects, being widely utilized by almost all tooling and block builders. It is integrated into Reth, multiple Layer 2 variants and other clients, serving as a standard for zkVMs.

## Features

- High-performance EVM implementation
- Mainnet transaction execution
- Powerful inspection and tracing capabilities
- Framework for EVM variants support
- Extensive testing and benchmarking tools

## Installation

Add revm to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
revm = "latest_version"
```

## Usage

### Basic Example

```rust
use revm::{Context, EVM};

// Create an EVM instance with mainnet configuration
let mut evm = Context::mainnet()
    .with_block(block)
    .build_mainnet();

// Execute a transaction
let out = evm.transact(tx);

// Use the inspector for transaction tracing
let mut evm = evm.with_inspector(tracer);
let out = evm.inspect_with_tx(tx);
```

For more complex examples, including foundry cheatcodes and custom inspectors, please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.rs/revm).

Revm offers two primary applications: firstly, it functions as an executor where users can set up block info and process mainnet transactions; secondly, it acts as a framework that facilitates the extension and support of different EVM variants such as revm-optimism.

### How to use:

Here is a straightforward example of using the Execution API: It allows us to create an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and execute transactions. Additionally, it can be utilized to generate traces with the inspector or more complex example of foundry cheatcodes.

```rust,ignore
let mut evm = Context::mainnet().with_block(block).build_mainnet();
let out = evm.transact(tx);

// or you can use powerful inspection tool to trace it
let mut evm = evm.with_inspector(tracer);
let out = evm.inspect_with_tx(tx);
```

The Evm Framework API is somewhat complex to use, but this document provides a detailed explanation. It enables users to extend logic, incorporate various context types, and offers built-in support for inspection. For a practical example, you can refer to the revm-optimism crate.

### Users:

The full list of projects that use Revm is available in the awesome-revm section of the book.

### How to, dev section

Note that book and code docs are still in WIP stage and they are being updated!

Part of the links point to the code documentation or the book. code docs are there to explain usage of particular part of the code where book is to get more of the overview on architecture or how components/projects fit toggether.
